        <h3>Why use our product?</h3>

        <p>In this day and age mornings can be chaotic.  There are kids to be fed, lunches to be made, and work to get to on time.  With pets you have the added problem of making sure that they get fed before you leave for the day.  Also, what happens when you have to work late, or the family is going out for a couple days!  Sure there is always the neighbor kid, but heâ€™s shifty.  Well we are planning on building a solution to that very problem.</p><br>

<a name="How do I set the time?"></a> <!Bookmark Target Destination>
        <h3>How do I set the time?</h3>

<a name="How do I set the unit to text/email me when it is nearly or completely empty?"></a> <!Bookmark Target Destination>
        <h3>How do I set the unit to text/email me when it is nearly or completely empty?</h3>

        <p>Text messages are set up on the "Feed" page. Fill in your text message capable phone number in the spaces next to "SMS number", click "Submit" and the unit will notify you if there are any problems.</p><br>

<a name="Is the RFID safe?"></a> <!Bookmark Target Destination>
        <h3>Is the RFID safe?</h3>

<a name="Can I change the Dinner Bell sound?"></a> <!Bookmark Target Destination>

        <h3>What is My Pet Watch?</h3>

<a name="How does the Feed Now switch work?"></a> <!Bookmark Target Destination>
        <h3>How does the Feed Now button work?</h3>

        <p>It will release a pre-set 1 cup amount of food into the bowl any time the button is pressed. This button is good for testing the unit when you first get it and feeding your pet immediately after a power outage.</p><br>
